Project Name: Road Accident Dashboard

Introduction:
This project presents the Road Accident Dashboard, a comprehensive analysis of road accident data. Due to the large file size, a video recording is provided to showcase the dashboard's functionality.

Key Areas Explored:
- Data Cleaning: Null values and duplicates were addressed to ensure the integrity of the data.
- Casualty Analysis: Various aspects of casualties post-accident were explored, including severity, vehicle types, and road conditions, utilizing donut charts, line charts, treemaps, sliders, and filters.
- Monthly Trends: Trends over time were analyzed, comparing data from the current year to previous years.
- Casualty Patterns: Patterns in casualties based on road type and surface distribution were identified.
- Casualty Relations: Relationships between casualties, area, time of day, and vehicle involvement were examined.

Key Insights Revealed:
- The analysis revealed that cars and buses have a higher occurrence of casualties.
- Certain road types, such as slight carriageways and dual carriageways, were identified as top locations for casualties.
- Casualties are more likely to occur on dry road surfaces.

Project Highlights:
- This project simulates real-world scenarios and fosters collaboration by engaging stakeholders and meeting their needs.
- Despite being a practice run, the dashboard features an interactive filter panel, providing intuitive navigation and access to additional resources such as data sources and Wikipedia.

Conclusion:
The Road Accident Dashboard offers valuable insights into road accident data, facilitating informed decision-making and enhancing road safety measures. The interactive features and comprehensive analysis make it a valuable tool for stakeholders in the field.
